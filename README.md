Visualizing GTFS data from the Digital Matatus project: http://www.digitalmatatus.com/map.html

Here is one example visualation: https://vimeo.com/211818841

See `Nairobi Data Wrangling.ipynb` for the python notebook containing all of the steps to transform the GTFS data into a format necessary for animation.

To run the program yourself, you will need to have [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/) installed. If you have those, simply open the `animation/animation.pde` file and click play.
